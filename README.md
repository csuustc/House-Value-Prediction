# House-Value-Prediction

This project aims to build linear regression models to predict median house value(**medv**) in Boston. The dataset is composed by 506 neighborhoods around Boston, including **medv** and 13 predictors such as **rm** (average number of rooms per house), **age** (average age of houses), and **lstat** (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).

This data frame contains the following columns:

- **crim**: per capita crime rate by town.

- **zn**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

- **indus**: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

- **chas**: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

- **nox**: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

- **rm**: average number of rooms per dwelling.

- **age**: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

- **dis**: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

- **rad**: index of accessibility to radial highways.

- **tax**: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.

- **ptratio**: pupil-teacher ratio by town.

- **black**: $1000(B_{k}-0.63)^2$ where $B_{k}$ is the proportion of blacks by town.

- **lstat**: lower status of the population (percent).

- **medv**: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
